15. This Examplecomputes the wrong valuefor size. Why?
   #include <iostream.h>
   #define SIZE 10;
   #define FUDGE SIZE -2;
   main ()
   {
   int size; // Size to really use
   size = FUDGE;
   cout << "Size is " << size << '\n';
   return (0);
   }

   Answer:
   #define SIZE 10;
   #define FUDGE SIZE -2;
   This program the preprocessor to macro define and (;)semicolon to end the statement. Therefore they assigned
   the value and deos not to change. If we remove the semicolon to solve the problem.
   #define SIZE 10
   #define FUDGE SIZE -2	//This gives the correct answer
