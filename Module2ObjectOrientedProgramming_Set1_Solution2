2.	What is the output of the below code snippet. Provide necessary explanation to support your view.

#include <iostream>
class BaseClass
{
    int x;
public:
    int y;
    void set(int a,int b)
    {
        x=a;
        y=b;
    }
    void show()
    {
        std::cout<<"X ="<<x;
    }
};
class DerivedClass :public BaseClass
{
    int i;
};
int main()
{
    int baseSize,derivedSize;
    BaseClass bc;
    DerivedClass dc;
    derivedSize=sizeof(dc);
    baseSize=sizeof(bc);
    std::cout<<"Size of BaseClass "<<baseSize << "\n";
    std::cout<<"Size of DerivedClass "<<derivedSize << "\n";
    return 0;
}

Output: Size of BaseClass 8  
        Size of DerivedClass 12
Explaination: Size of int is 4 bytes, In base class have two integer so the size is 8 and derived class have one integer type.
In this program derived class derives the base class, so 4+8=12.
