20. In Example the first loop works, but the second fails. Why?
    #include <iostream.h>
    main ()
    {
    short int i;
    // Works
    for (i = 0x80; i !=0; i = (i >> 1)) {
    cout << "i is " << hex << i << dec << '\n';
    }
    signed char ch;
    // Fails
    for (ch = 0x80; ch!=0; ch = (ch >> 1))
    cout << "ch is " << hex << int(ch) << dec << '\n';
    }
    return (0);
    }

    Answer:
    In this program char ch which have the size is 8 bits, Here(ch>>1)using rightshift opertor 
    it increaments the bit size, so the program fails.
