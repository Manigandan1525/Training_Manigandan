18. The following program tells us we have an undefined variable, but our only variable name is counter. Why?
    #include <iostream.h>
    #define RECIPROCAL (number) (1.0 / (number))
    main()
    }
    float counter;
    for (counter = 0.0; counter < 10.0;
    counter += 1.0)
    cout << "1/" << counter << " = "<<
    RECIPROCAL(counter) << "\n";
    }
    return (0);
    }

    Answer:
    The problem is having space between RECIPROCAL and (number).To remove the space it executes correctly.
    #define RECIPROCAL(number) (1.0 / (number))	//This expression is correct
