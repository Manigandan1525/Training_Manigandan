17. What does the above program output? (Try running it on your machine.). Why did it output what it did? 
    (Try checking the output of the preprocessor.)
    #include <iostream.h>
    #define SQR(x) ((x) * (x))
    main ()
    {
    int counter; /* Counter for loop */
    counter = 0;
    while (counter < 5)
    cout << "x << counter + 1 <<
    " x squared" << SQR(++counter) << '\n';
    return (0);
    }

    Answer:
    In this program SQR(++counter) expression have problem.
    SQR(++counter)=(( ++counter ) * ( ++counter )
    This expression counter increaments 2times. so the output is changed.
    Output:
    x 3 x squared 4
    x 5 x squared 16
    x 7 x squared 36
