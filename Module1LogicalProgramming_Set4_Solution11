11. What is the error in this program?
    #include <iostream.h>
    /*
    * This program produces a Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion
    * chart for the numbers 0 to 100.
    *
    * Restrictions:
    * This program deals with integers only, so the
    * calculations may not be exact.
    */
    // The current Celsius temperature we are working with
    int celsius;
    main() {
    for (celsius = 0; celsius <= 100; ++celsius);
    cout << "Celsius: " << celsius <<
    " Fahrenheit: " << ((celsius * 9) / 5 + 32) << '\n';
    return (0);
    }
    When run, this program prints out:
    Celsius: 101 Fahrenheit: 213
    and nothing more. Why?

    Answer:
    for (celsius = 0; celsius <= 100; ++celsius);  // (;)semicolon is the error
    In this program the end of  for loop we give the (;)semicolon, so the loop executes continously and when the condition failed to exit the loop.
    after the variable having the value is printed.
