1. The following will work on a UNIX machine but will fail on a PC
int zip; // zip code for current address
........
zip = 92126;
Why does this fail? What will be the result when run on a PC?

Answer:
 In UNIX machines, it takes the size of integers, that are 4 Bytes and the range is between -2147483648 to 2147483647.
 In PC, most of the compilers takes the size of integer as 2 Bytes and the range is between -32768 to 32767.
so this program fail and gives wrong value.
This program run on PC gives the result is 26590(wrong answer).
