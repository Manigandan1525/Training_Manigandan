10.  For some strange reason, the program here thinks that everyoneowes a balance of O dollars. Why?
     #include <iostream.h>
     int balance_owed; // amount owed
     main ()
     {
     cout << "Enter number of dollars owed:";
     cin >> balance_owed;
     if (balance_owed = 0)
     cout << "You owe nothing.\n";
     else
     cout << "You owe " << balance_owed << " dollars.\n";
     return (0);
     }
     Sample output:
     Enter number of dollars owed: 12
     You owe 0 dollars.

     Answer:
     Inside the if-condition we assign the value to variable, the value is false so it prints else statement.
