19. In the following program, the HIGH_SPEED flag works, but theDIRECT_CONNECT flag does not. Why?
    #include <iostream.h>
    const int HIGH_SPEED = (1<<7); /* modem is running fast */
    // we are using a hardwired connection
    const int DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8);
    char flags = 0; // start with nothing
    main()
    {
    flags |= HIGH_SPEED; // we are running fast
    flags |= DIRECT_CONNECT; // because we are wired together
    if ((flags & HIGH_SPEED) != 0)
    cout <<"High speed set\n";
    if ((flags & DIRECT_CONNECT) != 0)
    cout <<"Direct connect set\n";
    return (0);
    }

    Answer:
    In this program DIRECT_CONNECT = (1<<8); 
    flags |= DIRECT_CONNECT; the flags is character type, so flags is does not exist in eight bits(range -128 to 128).
    Therefore the solution is flags can be use integer datatype.
