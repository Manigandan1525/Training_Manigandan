13.The following program generates the answer 47 instead of the expected answer 144. Why?
   #include <iostream.h>
   #define FIRST_PART 7
   #define LAST_PART 5
   #define ALL_PARTS FIRST_PART + LAST_PART
   main()
   {
   cout << "The square of all the parts is " <<
   ALL_PARTS * ALL_PARTS << '\n';
   return (0);
   }

   Answer:
    ALL_PARTS * ALL_PARTS = FIRST_PART + LAST_PART * FIRST_PART + LAST_PART
		                      = 7 + 5 * 7 + 5
		                      = 47
