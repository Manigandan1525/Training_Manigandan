4. Why does the following program print incorrect answers?
  #include <iostream.h>
  int array[3][5] = { // Two dimensional array
  { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 },
  {10, 11, 12, 13, 14 },
  {20, 21, 22, 23, 24 }
  };
  main()
  {
  cout << "Last element is " << array[2,4] << '\n';
  return (0);
  }
  Answer:
  array[2,4]  this syntax is wrong. (,)comma operator does not use in Two dimensional array. 
  array[row][column] is the correct syntax.
  correct code: cout << "Last element is " << array[2][4] << '\n';  //This gives correct answer
