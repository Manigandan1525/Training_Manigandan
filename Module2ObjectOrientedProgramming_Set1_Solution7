7.	What is wrong in this program? If there is any problem with the below code, provide the corrected code.
class Human
{
public:
Human() {}
~ Human(){}
};
class Pilot: public Human
{
public:
Pilot():Human(){}
~ Pilot(){}
};
int main(void)
{
Human* george = new Pilot();
  delete george;
}

Answer: This program allocated an object with dynamic storage duration,which means it will not be destructed until 
you explicitly use delete to do so.
