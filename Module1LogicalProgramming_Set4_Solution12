12.This program reads a list of five numbers and counts the number of threes and sevens in the data. Why does it 
   give us the wrong answers?
   include <iostream.h>
   int seven_count; // Number of sevens in the data
   int data[5]; // The data to count 3 and 7 in
   int three_count; // Number of threes in the data
   int index; // Index into the data
   main() {
   seven_count = 0;
   three_count = 0;
   cout << "Enter 5 numbers\n";
   cin >> data[1] >> data[2] >> data[3] >>
   data[4] >> data[5];
   for (index = 1; index <= 5; ++index)
   if (data[index] == 3)
   ++three_count;
   if (data[index] == 7)
   ++seven_count;
   }
   cout << "Threes " << three_count << " Sevens " << seven_count << '\n';
   return (0);
   }
   When we run this program with the data 3 73 0 2, the results are:
   Threes 4 Sevens 1
   (Your results may vary.)

   Answer:
   In this program int data[5]; is declaring the array of size 5,we read the data from data[1] to data[5].
   array starts with 0, so it only allow data[0] to data[4].  Here read the data[5] value, so strange is happen. 
   therefore data[5] value is change to three_count. This problem to vary the result.
   cin >> data[0] >> data[1] >> data[2] >> data[3] >> data[4];    //solution
