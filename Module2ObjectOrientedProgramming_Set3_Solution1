1.	Briefly describe a possible collection of classes which can be used to represent a music 
collection (for example, inside a music player), focusing on how they would be related by 
composition. You should include classes for songs, artists, albums and playlists. 

Hint: write down the four class names, draw a line between each pair of classes which 
you think should have a relationship, and decide what kind of relationship would be the most appropriate.

For simplicity you can assume that any song or album has a single “artist” value (which 
could represent more than one person), but you should include compilation albums 
(which contain songs by a selection of different artists). The “artist” of a compilation 
album can be a special value like “Various Artists”. You can also assume that each song 
is associated with a single album, but that multiple copies of the same song (which are 
included in different albums) can exist.

Answer:
#include <iostream>     //using input and output
using namespace std;
class song
{
public:
    string title;       //initialize the variable
    string album;
    string artist;
    void shuffle_song()
    {
        //shuffle the song
    }
    void search_by_name()
    {
        //song search by name
    }
    void play_song()
    {
        //playing the song
    }
};      //class
class album:song
{
public:
    void show_in_album()
    {
        //songs show in album
    }
    void shuffle_by_album()
    {
        //shuffle the song by album
    }
    void play_album_song()
    {
        //play the song in album
    }
};      //class
class artist:song
{
public:
    void show_in_artist()
    {
        //songs show in artist
    }
    void shuffle_by_artist()
    {
        //shuffle the song by artist
    }

    void play_artist_song()
    {
        //play the song in artist
    }
};      //class
class playlist:song
{
public:
    void create_playlist()
    {
        //creating the playlist
    }
    void addsong_in_playlist()
    {
        //Add songs in playlist
    }
    void play_playlist_song()
    {
        //play the song
    }
};      //class
int main()
{
    song s;             //creating object for classes
    album a;
    artist ar;
    playlist p;
    return 0;
}
