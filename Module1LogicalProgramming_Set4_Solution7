7. Why does the following program fail to print the correct zip code? What does
   it print instead?
   long int zip; // Zip code
   main()
   {
   zip = 02137L; // Use the zip code for Cambridge MA
   cout << "New York's zip code is: " << zip << '\n';
   return(0);
   }

   Answer:
   zip=02137L; 0 represents the octal, so this value convert decimal to octal and zip is integer type so does not take 'L'.
   Output: New York's zip code is: 1119
