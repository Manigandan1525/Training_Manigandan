9. How will you change the program to print ch as int?
    #include <iostream.h>
    signed char ch; // Very short integer
    // Range is -128 to 127
    int main()
   {
   ch = 37;
   cout << "The number is " <<ch << '\n';
   return (0);
   }

   Answer:
   In this program, print statement we can change ch to (int)ch.
   cout << "The number is " <<(int)ch << '\n';   //It prints the integer value of ch
