2. Why does this program print ''The value of 1/3 is 0"? What must be done to this
   program to fix it?
   #include <iostream.h>
   float answer; // the result of the divide
   main ()
   {
    answer = 1/3;
    cout << "The value of 1/3 is " << answer << "\n";
    return (0);
   }

   Answer:
    answer=1/3;
    Here 1 and 3 are integers,so evaluation gives integer result.
    The value of 1/3 is 0
    When we change 1 and 3 as float type it gives correct answer
    answer=(float)1/(float)3;
    The value of 1/3 is 0.333333
