3.Example is designed to compute the area of a triangle, given its width
  and height. For some strange reason, the compiler refuses to believe that we declared thevariable width. 
  The declaration is right there on line two, just after the definition of
  height. Why isn't the compiler seeing it?
  #include <iostream.h>
  int height; /* the height of the triangle
  int width; /* the width of the triangle */
  int area; /* area of the triangle (computed) */
  main()
  {
  cout << "Enter width height? ";
  cin >> width >> height;
  area = (width * height) / 2;
  cout << "The area is " << area << '\n';
  return (0);
  }

  Answer:
  In this program we open the comment(/*) on line2 and close the comment(*/) on end of the next line.
  so the compiler takes (int height;)the declaration also comment.
  This is correct option
  int height; /* the height of the triangle*/
  int width; /* the width of the triangle */
