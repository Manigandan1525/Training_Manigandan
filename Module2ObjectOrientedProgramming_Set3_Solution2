2.	Design classes for a discount system which can be used in places that provides services 
and sells any products. The system should offer 3 types of memberships: Premium, Gold 
and Silver. Premium, gold and silver members receive a discount of 20%, 15%, and 
10%, respectively, for all services provided. Customers without membership receive no 
discount. All members receives a flat 10% discount on products purchased (this might change in future).

Answer:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
const int product1=12000;           //products price
const int product2=10000;
const int product3=25000;
const int service=500;
class discount_system
{
private:
    int count_product1=0,count_product2=0,count_product3=0,count_serviceproduct=0;  
    int amount=0,offer=0,option=0;

public:

    void select_products()
    {
        cout<<"select your product and service"<<"\n";    //product count
        cout<<"select product1 count:";
        cin>>count_product1;
        cout<<"select product2 count:";
        cin>>count_product2;
        cout<<"select product3 count:";
        cin>>count_product3;
        cout<<"select service product count:";
        cin>>count_serviceproduct;
        amount=count_product1*product1+count_product2*product2+count_product3*product3+count_serviceproduct*service;
    }
    void discount()
    {
    cout<<"select your Membership \n1.Premium \n2.Gold \n3.Silver \n4.Not Membership";
    cin>>option;
    switch(option)        //using switch
    {
    case 1:cout<<"Premium membership gives 20% offer \n";
           offer=amount*20/100;
           break;
    case 2:cout<<"gold membership gives 15% offer \n";
           offer=amount*15/100;
           break;
    case 3:cout<<"Silver membership gives 10% offer \n";
           offer=amount*10/100;
           break;
    case 4:cout<<"No offer receive";
           break;
     }
     cout<<"Purchased product amount"<<"\n";
     amount=amount-((amount*10/100)+offer);
     cout<<amount;
    }
};      //class
int main()
{
    discount_system dis;
    dis.select_products();
    dis.discount();
    return 0;
}
